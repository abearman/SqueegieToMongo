This means there will no longer be cash accepted at the Toll Plaza nor any toll collectors in the toll lanes. Visitors heading southbound into San Francisco (the toll assessment direction) will have two new options for toll payment: One-Time Payment or a Toll Invoice. Find out more about the new toll payment options on their website. (Website comes in various languages including Chinese, Spanish, German, Korean, French, and more) ",

            "Alcatraz Island, located in the middle of San Francisco Bay, is a must-see attraction for any visitor to the area.  One of the most infamous prisons in the country for housing notorious criminals, Alcatraz holds much history that will interest buffs and novices alike.  No longer housing prisoners and managed by the National Park Service, Alcatraz allows tourists to visit by the boatload.  Alcatraz was used as a federal maximum security prison from 1934 until 1963, when it was closed due to high costs and security issues.",
            "The tour is open 7 days a week. Anyone intending to visit Alcatraz should book tickets online in advance from the official website, www.alcatrazcruises.com.  Tours can book up several days in advance, but it is easy to go online to purchase and print tickets.  (Reservations are taken 90 days in advance.)  With tickets in hand, proceed directly to Pier 33, Alcatraz Landing on San Francisco's Embarcadero.  Plan on arriving 30 minutes before your scheduled departure. The only line you need to stand in is the boarding line for your tour.  No printer, no problem.  Purchase tickets online and write down your confirmation number. Arrive at Pier 33 a bit earlier than the requested 30 minutes and go directly to Will Call.  Bring your confirmation number and photo ID to pick up the tickets.   ",
            "The award-winning Alcatraz Cellhouse audio tour is available in 10 languages - Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin, Spanish, Portuguese, and Korean. There's also a free iPhone tour.",
            "Alcatraz's most interesting tour is probably the Alcatraz Night Tour in which tourists are able to take the regular self guided walking tour (with the aid of headphones narrating the story of Alcatraz -- sometimes by the prisoners themselves who inhabited it) after all of the day visitors leave.  Many of the rooms (such as the dining hall) are only faintly lit by moonlight, making the eerie sounds of clinking dinnerware you hear in the headphones during your tour particularly creepy.",
            "The Alcatraz Night Tour operates year-round, Thursday-Monday evenings. The evening includes roundtrip ferry transportation, a live boat narration, a guided tour from Dock to Cellhouse, the Cellhouse Audio Tour, a keepsake souvenir brochure, and a variety of special presentations. Tickets are available online and children under age 5 are free.",
            "Proceeds from the Night Tour support preservation and restoration projects on Alcatraz and throughout the National Park.",
            "Additionally, the later Indian occupation of Alcatraz is chronicled through your tour guide, short films as you exit the prison, and many items in the gift shop before you depart the island.  Plan on spending about 2.5 hours from your departure to the island to your arrival back on San Francisco Pier 33.",
            "NOTE: National Park Service's authorized exclusive concessioner is www.alcatrazcruises.com.  ",

            "The Palace required a fair of amount of upkeep, though, and by the 50s it became obvious that the original construction would not last.  Caspar Weinberger, an assemblyman at the time, and a number of influential San Franciscans rallied to collect donations for reconstruction of the Palace.  Their efforts paid off as most of the original structure was torn down and reconstruction started in 1964, at a cost of ten times the original.  Today, the Palace of Fine Arts remains a beautiful picturesque oasis that lures tourists in with its simplistic beauty.",

The best introduction to the museum is to take one of the many free hour-long guided tours held daily of the museum's permanent collection, then return to those galleries that interest you the most on your own. You can take a free audio tour (available in English, Cantonese, Mandarin, Spanish and French) but the docents who give the tours love their subject, are well-informed, and provide an excellent introduction to the collection. In addition to \"Museum Masterpiece\" tours are other specialty tours that focus on either specific galleries or special collections. Each guide is different so a 4-5 hour visit can easily include three different guided tour, a short break, and some wandering around on your own.",

            "Yes, it is over-the-top touristy, although it has one or two high points.  Yet, for some reason, Fisherman's Wharf is San Francisco's most popular attraction.  So here are the fun places at the Wharf.",
            "Getting there: Take public transportation to the Wharf.  Nothing is a fun as a ride down  scenic Russian Hill on a clanking old cable car, arriving at the bay's edge to enjoy the day.  Avoid driving altogether -- parking can be REALLY expensive.  Musee Mecanique in the heart of Fisherman's Wharf, just past the big Fisherman's Wharf sign. Musee Mecanique's arcade machines were collected over decades by Edward Galland Zelinsky. Some of the mechanical artifacts, such as   \"Laffing Sal\"  are beloved icons from the once mighty Playland at the Beach on the city's western end, which entertained generations of San Franciscans from 1928-1972.",
            "The ships at the Hyde Street Pier, part of the National Parks, at the west end of the Wharf (on your way to Ghirardelli Square) are fun to explore, and rarely crowded.  These include the old sailing ship Balclutha and the WWII sub Pampinito.  Further down is the Maritime Museum (the big white building), but there is also a smaller Maritime Museum that is before you get to the Pier, right next to the Argonaut Hotel.  It's a hidden treasure -- free, uncrowded, and full of interesting displays, even a small movie theatre in the back. The outside of the building even looks like a ship. ",
            "Many people enjoy Boudin.  Keep in mind, however, that the Wharf is not known for being a culinary experience.  Many tourists enjoy claim chowder in a bread bowl here, but it is not a \"signature dish\" of San Francisco.  For that, head up to North Beach and try some cioppino!  There is a small fish and chips stand on Jones between Beach & Jefferson called \"Codmother's Fish and Chips\" that is a nice spot if the weather is nice; all seating is outdoors.  The Buena Vista is another possibiity ... especially if you'd care to have an Irish Coffee with lunch!",
            "Pier 39 has its fans and detractors. Kids tend to enjoy it. Keep in mind it was built solely as a tourist attraction.  But then something interesting happened, a fluke of nature. Juvenile sea lions following a good herring run discovered the adjacent boat dock (K-dock) in January 1990 and hauled out there... in large numbers. What seemed  to be a loud, smelly and temporary annoyance turned into a major tourist attraction, as people (including locals) flocked to Pier 39 to see them. The sea lions were credited with rescuing the tourist business after the Oct. 17, 1989 earthquake, and a grateful (and enterprising) Pier 39 quickly capitalized nature's gift, even fashioning a sea lion topiary at the entrance.",
            "If you are interested in visiitng Alcatraz, buy tickets online through the official website in advance.  Tickets go on sale 90 days in advance.  It's a fascinating tour, starting with a fun boat ride and ending with spectacular views.  If you have kids, have them read \"Al Capone Does My Shirts\" before they go -- it's a great juvenile fiction (grade 5 or so?) about a boy who lives on Alcatraz (his dad works there) when Al Capone is imprisoned there. They also have a night tour of \"The Rock,\" which is both creepy and a real blast. AlcatrazCruises.com is the official website for tickets.",
            "For a solid reference on activities, restaurants, maps and shopping at Fisherman's Wharf visit the Fisherman's Wharf Community Benefit Districtt website or the Fisherman's Wharf Merchants Assn Website.",
            "Overall Fisherman's Wharf and the surrounding area (Ghirardelli Square and Pier 39) deserve an hour or two.  Then move on to see the real San Francisco."

            "If you can't make a backstage tour, tours are given every Monday (except holidays) which covers all three theatres that make up the Performaing Arts Center (Davies Symphony Hall, War Memorial Opera House and Herbst Theatre in the Veterans Building).  These are front of the house tours of the three theatres.  History of the buildings and the Company's that use them are covered in this 90 minute tour.  A 10% discount at the Symphony store is available for those on the tour.  Tours start from Davies Hall on the hour from 10AM - 2PM (Grove St. box office entrance).  No reservations are necessary.  $5 Adult, $3 senior/student. ",

            "San Francisco's Chinatown is the largest outside of Asia.  It is a place many visitors want to see and put high on their list of places to go.  But read the reviews and many are quite negative.  Why?  Because it is an intense, densely populated area that still retains its ethnic identity.  If all of San Francisco's 49 square miles were as closely packed as Chinatown, the city's population would be 8 MILLION (rather than about 800,000). ",
            "Slightly larger in area than Manhattan's Chinatown, it is situated within Bush in the south, Montgomery to the east, Taylor in the west, Green in the north north-west, and scattered throughout Russian Hill, North Beach, and Telegraph Hill going as far north as Lombard. With over 300 restaurants and as many shops in the expanded area, Chinatown offers more dining and shopping options per capita than any other neighborhood in San Francisco.",
            "The best way to \"do\" Chinatown is on a walking tour.  There are a variety of them.  Some are free, such as the San Francisco City Guides, which have walking tours all over the city. Some charge, such as \"All About Chinatown,\" and Shirley Fong Torres' \"Wok Wiz.\"  For a unique tour experience, look up the Chinatown Alleyway Tours program which is a tour program led by youth who have deep roots to Chinatown.",
            "Some tours include (or have the option of including) a dim sum lunch at a Chinatown restaurant.  Whatever your time, desire or budget allow, take a tour of some sort.  Chinatown is not about looking at buildings or even reading from a guidebook.  There is much in it's rich history that needs to be explored.  Even for a local (albeit not an Asian) walking into a temple is not your everyday experience.  Only with a guide who is familiar with the ins and outs of Chinatown will a visitor get real insight and perspective. There are also some excellent museums. The Chinese Historical Society of California on Sacramento Street is in a beautifully restored Julia Morgan building that was once the YWCA (Morgan, for those unfamiliar with one of California's pioneering female architects, designed Hearst Castle). There is also the Chinese Cultural Center inside the Hilton Hotel (the Hilton was built on city redevelopment land, hence the public space), which has interesting gallery displays and a good gift shop.",
            "The back alleys of Chinatown have over a century of history.  They are still populated by immigrants from the Guangdong Province, the first of whom came in the mid-1800's.  Chinatown is one part of old San Francisco that flourishes today. ",
            "Yes, it is crowded; no, it is not spic-and-span. But it is a living, breathing, exceptionally ethnic neighborhood that flourishes cheek-to-jowl amid the high-rises of downtown.  This is NOT Disneyland. ",
            "So for those people who go and say \"don't bother,\" sorry, you did not see the real Chinatown!  ",

            "San Francisco's Japantown is one of three left in California. It was once a flourishing center for the Japanese-Americans of San Francisco until World War II, when 120,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans were ordered into ten internment camps in the country's interior. A smaller Japantown is in San Jose and a larger one is in Los Angeles (also known as \"Little Tokyo.\")",
            "Some of Japantown's history can be found among the Victorian buildings that are common in the larger Western Addition neighborhood that surrounds it. One of the oldest Go houses in the country was on Bush Street. The former Julia Morgan-designed YWCA, which currently houses Japantown's \"Nihonmachi Little Friends\" community day care center, was one of the early community institutions. The 1934-era building replaced an earlier structure.",
            "One of San Francisco's best-kept secrets is the shopping mall known as Japan Center, which is part of the larger Japantown .  The wide range of Japanese restaurants and shops is unparalleled anywhere else in the Bay Area.  Spend a whole afternoon looking at clothing, pottery, teapots, plates, bowls and chopsticks from Japan as well as music and other cultural exports.  Love manga? Check out the Kinokuniya Bookstore for that and so much more.",
            "Then make sure to stop by the busy Isobune Sushi where the sushi arrives on boats floating on an oval waterway and your bill is calculated by adding up how many of each colored plate you have piled in front of you. After the movies, you'll find many San Francisco locals flocking to Mifune for excellent noodles and light fare.  As a final stop, you can go by the Japanese grocery store and pick up an assortment of unusual snacks and deserts to impress your friends at home.",
            "Japantown is the least crowded all day during the weekdays, and gets busy during the weekends starting in the afternoons.  If you are considering to come during their most heavily populated times with free entertainment and tasty food, visit the Cherry Blossom Festival (mid April for two weekends) and the Nihonmachi Street Fair (one weekend in early August)."
