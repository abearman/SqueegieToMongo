        "description": "<p>Amongst the distribution warehouses of South San Francisco's industrial area, Dudley Perkins' dealership and showroom beckons hog enthusiasts to come and admire the bikes on display, while also taking in a bit of bike history. At once a showroom, repair shop and Harley-Davidson museum, the building also houses an apparel and accessories store.<\/p> <p>While most of the bikes on display are for sale, a few of the older models are considered museum pieces only, adding to the dealership's richly historic feel.<\/p> <p>Its location in the heart of the industrial district (where it moved from San Francisco in 2006) may seem like an odd choice, but not only does it make for easy parking and expansion, but it also allows bikers to rev their engines as much and as loudly as they want.  <\/p>",
